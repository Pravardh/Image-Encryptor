# Image Encryptor

This is a simple Python application that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for encrypting and decrypting images using the AES encryption algorithm. The application is built using the Tkinter library for the GUI and the cryptography library for AES encryption.

## Features

- **Encryption:** Allows users to select an image file from their local file system and encrypt it using AES encryption.
- **Decryption:** Enables users to select an encrypted image file and decrypt it to obtain the original image.
- **Key Generation:** Generates encryption keys securely for use in AES encryption and stores them in a key file.
- **User Interface:** Provides an intuitive user interface with buttons for encryption and decryption operations, along with a dropdown menu to select encrypted image files for decryption.
- **File Management:** Handles file operations such as reading, writing, and deleting image files securely from the local file system.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
